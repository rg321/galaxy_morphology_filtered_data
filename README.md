# galaxy_morphology_filtered_data

Subset of https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge. We pick galaxy classifications with high probability only, as described in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3496.pdf. Thus, the original kaggle dataset of 60,000 images is reduced to 28,790 images, with 5 classes viz spiral, edge-on, cigar-shaped smooth, in-between smooth, and completely round smooth.

Three folder -:

imageFolder_full : complete data with 28,790 images

imageFolder_medium : complete data with around 500 images

imageFolder_small : complete data with around 50 images
